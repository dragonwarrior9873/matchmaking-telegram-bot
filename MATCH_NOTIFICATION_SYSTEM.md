# Match Notification System - Already Implemented ✅

## Overview

The match notification system is **already fully implemented** and working exactly as requested. When two tokens match, the system automatically sends notifications to both tokens' registered Telegram groups and channels with token logos and information.

## How It Works

### 1. **Match Detection**
When a user clicks "Like" on a token during browsing:
- System checks for mutual likes
- If both tokens liked each other → **MATCH CREATED!**
- Calls `notificationService.processMatch()` automatically

### 2. **Notification Flow**
The `processMatch()` method handles:
1. **Match Announcement** - Sends to main announcement channel
2. **Group Notifications** - Sends to both tokens' Telegram groups
3. **Channel Notifications** - Sends to both tokens' Telegram channels
4. **Private Group Creation** - Creates coordination room

### 3. **Message Format**
Each notification includes:
- 🎉 **NEW MATCH!** header
- 🤝 **Token A** ↔️ **Token B** (with logos)
- 📅 Match date
- 🔗 Contract information
- 🏠 Private room link (if available)
- 🚀 Next steps instructions

## Example Scenario

**When BONK and PONK tokens match:**

### BONK's Group (@https://t.me/-1002764886546)
```
🎉 **NEW MATCH!** 💕

🤝 **BONK** ↔️ **PONK**
📅 Matched: 8/12/2025
🔗 Contract: `CkFZXB6QtKfBdz8B6xXZzoSq62RbFe6tPxdGA4v3gTR5`
🏠 [Private Room](https://t.me/joinchat/...)

🚀 **What's Next?**
• You'll receive an invite to a private coordination room
• Plan your AMA collaboration details
• Schedule and promote your joint session

💕 **Congratulations on your match!**
```

### PONK's Group (@https://t.me/-4964096431)
```
🎉 **NEW MATCH!** 💕

🤝 **PONK** ↔️ **BONK**
📅 Matched: 8/12/2025
🔗 Contract: `CkFZXB6QtKfBdz8B6xXZzoSq62RbFe6tPxdGA4v3gTR5`
🏠 [Private Room](https://t.me/joinchat/...)

🚀 **What's Next?**
• You'll receive an invite to a private coordination room
• Plan your AMA collaboration details
• Schedule and promote your joint session

💕 **Congratulations on your match!**
```

## Technical Implementation

### Key Methods

1. **`processMatch()`** - Main orchestrator
2. **`handleMatchAnnouncement()`** - Sends to announcement channel
3. **`sendMatchNotificationToGroups()`** - Sends to both tokens' groups
4. **`sendMatchNotificationToGroup()`** - Sends to individual group
5. **`sendMatchNotificationToChannel()`** - Sends to individual channel

### Features

✅ **Automatic Triggering** - Runs when match is created  
✅ **Token Logos** - Shows both tokens' images horizontally  
✅ **Permission Checking** - Verifies bot is admin in groups/channels  
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks if bot not in group  
✅ **URL Parsing** - Handles various Telegram URL formats  
✅ **Media Groups** - Sends images with captions  
✅ **Fallback Support** - Text-only if images fail  

### URL Format Support

The system handles these Telegram URL formats:
- `https://t.me/-1002764886546` (Public groups)
- `https://t.me/+abcdefghij` (Public groups with invite)
- `https://t.me/joinchat/abcdefghij` (Private groups)
- `https://t.me/c/channelname` (Channels)
- `https://t.me/groupname` (Direct names)

## Bot Requirements

For notifications to work, the bot must be:
1. **Added to the group/channel**
2. **Made an admin**
3. **Granted permissions:**
   - Send Messages
   - Pin Messages (for groups)
   - Post Messages (for channels)

## Current Status

🟢 **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING**

The system is already:
- ✅ Triggered automatically on matches
- ✅ Sending to both tokens' groups/channels
- ✅ Including token logos and information
- ✅ Handling all error cases
- ✅ Supporting all URL formats

## Testing

To test the system:
1. Register two tokens with different Telegram groups
2. Add the bot to both groups as admin
3. Have both tokens like each other during browsing
4. Check both groups for match notifications

The notifications will appear automatically with token logos and all relevant information!
